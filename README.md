# To do list app
A simple and fun to-do list app built with React. You can add tasks, mark them as done, and give them a priority that changes how they glow on hover. Animations are handled with Framer Motion, and styles are kept tidy using CSS Modules. Just a clean little project to practice modern front-end skills!
